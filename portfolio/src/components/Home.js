        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>I have a wide range of experience that makes me uniquely well rounded. This quality makes me a valuable asset to any company. My military experience taught me leadership, and how to be an effective member of a team. My building experience taught me attention to detail, and how to deliver a professional, finished product to a customer.</p>
        <p>My tech experience in Customer Support and QA allow me to see the larger picture, and gave me a familiarity with the entire development process. As a QA Tester, I used my customer support experience to keep the users' needs in mind, which in turn made for a better final product.</p>
        <p>I'm comfortable diving into projects by myself, and also enjoy collaboration with a team. I worked remote for a year so I can get the job done with little supervision.</p>
        <p>But it's not all just work! I love heading up into the mountains for the weekend, exploring new hiking trails, or finding a good spot on a river and going fly-fishing. As an avid baseball fan, I also enjoy going to Rockies games whenever I can.</p>
        <p>Iâ€™m looking for opportunities that allow me to continue learning, and to fine tune my skills as a developer. I'd love to join a team that I can contribute to, and through the developers around me, become a valuable addition to the company.</p>
